# NMA-DL Modality Mongoose Project

This project aims to translate between MRI modality types using deep learning.

The code in this repository is **heavily** inspired by the [Pytorch implementation of vox2vox](https://github.com/enochkan/vox2vox), a 3D volume-to-volume generative adversarial network proposed by [M. Cirillo, D. Abramian and A. Eklund](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13653)
